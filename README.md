# ESC190-Computer-Algorithms-And-Data-Structures

This is a repository of notes, lab work, projects and assignments from ESC190-Computer-Algorithms-And-Data-Structures, a course I took in Semester 2 of EngSci Year 1. My lab partner, [Jonah Chen](https://github.com/jonah-chen), and I collectively worked on the various projects throughout the course. The focus of the course was on learning various data structures and algorithms in C. We also touched on some foundational ML content near the end of the course (understanding backpropagation and more) in Python.
